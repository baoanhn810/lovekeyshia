[Intro]
| Fmaj7 | D7 | Gm7 | B♭maj7 |

[Verse]
Fmaj7                  D7
I used to think that I wasn't fine enough,
Gm7                  B♭maj7
And I used to think I wasn't wild enough,
Fmaj7                      D7
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out,
Gm7                  B♭maj7
Why you are playin' games—what’s this all about?

[Pre‑Chorus]
Fmaj7        D7
If I'm a good girl then why you hurt me so?
Gm7           B♭maj7        Fmaj7
If you're so right then why am I so wrong?

[Chorus]
Fmaj7             D7
Why you always wanna see what's undercover?
Gm7                B♭maj7
Why you actin' like you're not in love?
Fmaj7             D7
Even though you're always up for the other,
Gm7           B♭maj7
I guess you don't want me like I want… love
